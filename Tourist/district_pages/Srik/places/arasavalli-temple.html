            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Arasavalli Sri Surya Narayana Swamy Devalayam is a temple for Lord Surya, the solar deity, at Arasavalli in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. It is located in Arasavalli Village 1 km east of Srikakulam. It is believed that the temple was built in 7th century CE by King Devendra Varma, a great ruler of Eastern Ganga Dynasty of Kalinga. The present structure is largely a result of 18th-century renovations. The temple was built in Rekha deula style of Kalinga Architecture like Puri Jagannath temple of Odisha. This temple is considered one of the oldest sun temples in India. The temple is one of the two major (remaining out of three, as the third temple was destroyed by Sikandar Shah Miri) temples who worship Lord Surya in India. The other two are the Konark Sun Temple, Odisha and Martand Sun Temple, Jammu and Kashmir. The temple is built in such a way as to make the Sun Rays focus on the feet of the God twice in the year in the months of March and September in the early hours of the day . The rays so focused on the feet of the Idol through the five entrance gates of the temple , remain for a few minutes .

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>According to Padmapuranam , Sage Kasyapa installed the Idol of Surya at Arasavalli for the Welfare of mankind . Therefore , the Surya is of Kasyapasa Gotra . He is also termed as planetary King . According to the ' Sthalapuranam ' of the temple, Lord Devendra found this temple and installed the existing idol of the sun God commonly known as Lord suryanarayana Swamy Varu under the following circumstances.Once Lord Devendra , Ignoring the words of Dwarapalaka Nandi , attempted to force his entry for Darshan of Sri Rudrakoteswara Swamy varu at an untimely hour when Lord siva was along with his consort . The Dwarapalaka Nandi in the discharge of his duties kicked the intruder . Thus kicked and injured by the Devine attendent Indra fell down senseless. And in his unconscious state Indra dreamt that he would be relieved of his pain of injury in his chest caused by Nandi if he had built a temple and install an Idol of the Sun God . After regaining his consciousness, he remembered what he dreamt .Following his dream he pickedup handfulls of earth three times at a place where he lay, and there he found this beautiful idol of sun God with his three consorts Usha , Chaya and Padmini . At the base of the idols are the figures of Mathara and Pingala the Dwarapalakas and high up are the two divine saints , sanaka and sanadana holding 'Chatrams'(An Umbrella ). The Sun God is depicted as riding over a chariot drawn by Anura, the Radhasaradhy . All these figures are exquisitely carved out of a single black finely polished granite stoneArcheological experts say that the stone inscriptions available in the temple throw some light to the effect that Devendra Varma, the Ruler of the Kalinga Kingdom, must have build this temple and installed the image of the Sun God in it in the later half of the 7th Century . The translation of the stone inscriptions reveal the donation of some lands made to the Sun God for perpectual lamps to be installed in the temple , to run a school or a Hostel for the pupils learning Sastras and vedas . These donations are stated to have been made by the successors of the Calinga King Devendra Varma prior to 11th Century A.D. The walls also state the temple was fixed and changed to help with some of the sun temple's major flaws during the 18th and 19th century. Many of these changes were donated by the Dusi family. The temple fell into disrepair over the centuries and was reconstructed in 1778 CE by Elamanchili Pullaji Panthulu. Over the years the Sun temple was a landmark for many of the festivals celebrated in the town, including festival Rathasaptami.</p>
