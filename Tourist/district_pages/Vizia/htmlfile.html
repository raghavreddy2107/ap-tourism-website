    Vizianagaram District, located in the northeastern part of Andhra Pradesh, is a region with a rich history and cultural heritage, formed on June 1, 1979, by carving out areas from the neighboring Srikakulam and Visakhapatnam districts. Historically, it was part of the ancient Kalinga region, and its past is marked by significant events such as the fierce "Bobbili Yuddham" (Bobbili War) of 1757, a legendary battle between the Rajas of Vizianagaram and Bobbili, which is still celebrated for its tales of bravery and sacrifice. The district's headquarters, Vizianagaram city, is known as the "City of Victory" and was founded in 1712 by the Vizianagaram Rajas, who were patrons of education and the arts. Today, Vizianagaram District is a blend of historical landmarks, religious sites, and natural beauty.

Nature enthusiasts can explore the Thatipudi Reservoir, a scenic spot on the Gosthani River, and various waterfalls like Alakananda Waterfalls. The district is also known for its Bobbili Veena, a traditional Saraswati Veena renowned for its craftsmanship.

        <p>The Bobbili Veena is an exquisite, large plucked string instrument from the town of Bobbili in Vizianagaram district, revered in Carnatic classical music and earning a Geographical Indication (GI) tag in 2011–12 for its unique craftsmanship. Crafted entirely from a single piece of jackfruit wood—also called the “ekanda” method—it features a lion‑head carved end, bell‑metal frets, and a resonator made from a hollowed gourd, resulting in a light yet sonorous Saraswati veena. Its origins trace back to the 17th century under Pedda Rayudu’s reign, with a distinct local design asserted during a challenge by Vizianagaram craftsman Musanna Chinayya in the late 19th century, resulting in a longer, full‑toned veena (~54″ compared to the 42″ potti veena). The art of Bobbili Veena has been sustained by the Sarvasiddhi community of Gollapalli village for over three centuries—forming the Bobbili Veena sampradayam—with around 30–40 artisanal families still carrying on the tradition</p>
